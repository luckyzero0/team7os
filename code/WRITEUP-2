---USAGE---
To build Nachos:
	gmake (inside the userprog directory)
	
To build coff2noff:
	gmake coff2noff (inside the bin directory)
	
To build individual tests:
	gmake TEST_EXECUTABLE_FILE (inside the test directory)

To run simulation with user-input for desired numbers of things (and the "correct" print statements):
	nachos -rs XXXX -x ../test/*TEST_EXECUTABLE_FILE* (inside the userprog directory)

To run our big monster mega test (compiles nrun.cc, based on the utility on the class website), runs nachos with all -rs args 1-9998:
	g++ -onrun nrun.cc (inside the userprog directory)
	nrun


---DOCUMENTATION---

I. REQUIREMENTS

	The main assignment for Project 2 was the implementation of system calls, and the execution of the Passport Office
	as a user program executed on the simulated MIPS CPU with the Nachos OS handling system calls.

II. ASSUMPTIONS

	1.) Object oriented is for suckas.
	2.) The simulation halts (ends) when there are no customers left. This is because all threads go to 
		sleep when there are no customers, and nachos interprets this as the program terminating.

III. DESIGN

	Locks / Conditions:
		Global array of LockEntry and ConditionEntries that each user program can checkout, use, and destroy.
		Right now checked out locks / conditions are NOT automatically returned to the OS when a process is destroyed,
			that is still the application programmer's responsibility.
		
		The design / implementation of the syscalls relating to locks / conditions is nearl identical to that offered
			in the class notes.  As such, I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail here.
			
	Fork:
		Our Fork very closely follows the design offered in the Student Documentation section in the class website.
		Our only significant change was to make a thread have a globally unique ID, as well as keeping track of the virtual pages
			it uses.  These are useful later in exit, so we can give back virtual pages to our process, and physical pages to
			the operating system.
			
		We also implemented a ForkWithArg, that is exactly like fork, except it allows the user program to pass an arg
			to the forked thread, which can be collected in the new thread by calling GetForkArg().
			
	Exec:
		Again, this closely follows the design offered in the Student Documentation on the class website.  We did make
			a fair amount of changes to the AddrSpace constructor so that virtual pages always start at 0, and physical pages
			acquire are contiguous.  We also DO NOT zero out unitialized data section of the loaded executable, as none of our
			user programs make the assumption that uninitialized data is set to 0 (neither do programs on any OS as far as I know).
		
		Once constructed, the process is added to the process table so it can be cleaned up later in Exit().  If for some reason the process
			did not construct successfully, we immediately delete it and return a -1 SpaceID to the user program.
			
	Exit:
		If we are the last thread of the last process, we halt the machine.  If we are the last thread of a process, we delete the process
			and free its entry from the process table, handing back all its physical pages to the OS.  If we are not the final thread of a process,
			we just give up a thread's stack space.

		- machine.h (Changed around number of PhysPages)
		- thread.h/cc
		- synch.h/cc
		- addrspace.h/cc
		- syscall.h
		- system.cc
	
	+ Files Added
		- test/* (All the tests in the test directory)
		
	+ Data Structures Added
		AddrSpace* processTable[]; - keeps track of all open processes
		int threadArgs[]; - holds arguments to forked threads
		Bitmap physPageBitmap; - keeps track of which physical pages are checked out
		Lock* bigLock; - makes sure we don't have multiple threads / processes messing with any of the new data at once
		
	+ Data Structures Modified
		NONE
			
	+ Functions Added
		- New syscalls
			. Fork
			. Exec
			. Yield
			. Exit
			. Create/Destroy Lock/Condition
			. Acquire

			. Signal
			. Broadcast
			. ForkWithArg - Calls Fork and supplies an argument to the thread
			. GetForkArg - Called by a Thread to get its argument
			
		- Private Functions to AddrSpace and Thread

V. TESTING

	+ How to Test
	
		See USAGE above.
		
		The .c's listed below are the tests.  For example, to build, just do "gmake forkTest".
		
		PARTS 1 AND 2: ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	
				/*forkTest.c*/
		/* 
		 * Tests for forking. Checks against bad construction data,
		 * and confirms that two threads can run concurrently modifying
		 * global data.
		 * If successfull, x = 10 at the end of the test.
		 */
		 
				 /* halt.c
		 *	Simple program to test whether running a user program works.
		 *	
		 *	Just do a "syscall" that shuts down the OS.
		 *
		 * 	NOTE: for some reason, user programs with global data structures 
		 *	sometimes haven't worked in the Nachos environment.  So be careful
		 *	out there!  One option is to allocate data structures as 
		 * 	automatics within a procedure, but if you do this, you have to
		 *	be careful to allocate a big enough stack to hold the automatics!
		 */
		 
				 /* matmult.c 
		 *    Test program to do matrix multiplication on large arrays.
		 *
		 *    Intended to stress virtual memory system.
		 *
		 *    Ideally, we could read the matrices off of the file system,
		 *	and store the result back to the file system!
		 */
		 
				/*randTest.c*/
		*	Produces a few random numbers.
		*	Should always produce the exact same numbers for a given -rs value
		*/
		
				/* sort.c 
		*    Test program to sort a large number of integers.
		*
		*    Intention is to stress virtual memory system.
		*
		*    Ideally, we could read the unsorted array off of the file system,
		*	and store the result back to the file system!
		*/
		
				/*testConditions.c*/
		/*
		 * Tests CVs. Attempt to pass bad construction data,
		 * as well as access CVs with bad parameters.
		 * If successfully, bad CVs are not created, and
		 * t2 will run before t1.
		 * Finally, tests broadcast. If successful, all threads will
		 * exit.
		 */
		 
				 /*execTest.c*/
		/*
		 *	Tests the Exec function call with some bad input
		 *	as well as a normative case.
		 */
		 
				 /* exec_testLocks.c */
		/*	This will run the test "testLocks"
		*	in 9 processes simultaneously, then shutdown.
		*/
		 
				/* forkArg.c */
		/*	This test tries out the GetForkArg syscall to make sure that
		*	threads receive the appropriate argument. The behavior for
		*	GetForkArg on threads not forked with an arg is not guaranteed,
		*	but right now the implementation always returns -2.
		*/
		
				/* testLocks.c */
		/*	Quick test program to check if lock related SYSCALLS are working.
		* 	Performs a few tests to check bad construction data, as well as
		* 	Passing bad lock IDs to demonstrate attempting to acquire non-owned
		* 	locks.
		* 	The final test demonstrates a small mutex scenario, in which the final
		* 	result of raceCondition should should be 0, 5, or 10, depending on which
		* 	thread runs first, but never any value in between.
		*/

		
		PART 3: Passport Simulation ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
				/* officeMain.c */
		/*	This runs the office with the default values of 3 of each clerk,
		*	20 customers, and 3 senators.  Everything should escape the office,
		*	and the sum of cashier money should be $2300.
		*/
		
				/* officeMainDEBUG.c */
		/*	This runs the office with the default values of 3 of each clerk,
		*	20 customers, and 3 senators, with TESTING flag turned on for 
		*   enhanced output. Everything should escape the office,
		*	and the sum of cashier money should be $2300.
		*/
		
				/* exec_office.c */
		/* 
		 * Execs 4 office programs to run simultaneously to 
		 * test multiprogramming.
		 */
		 
			 /*senatorTest.c*/
		/* This test is to show that customers
		 * behave property in the presence
		 * of the allpowerful senators. 2 customers are
		 * forked and 1 senator. Everyone should exit 
		 * at the end.
		 */
		 
			 /*clerkBreakTest.c*/
		/* 
		 * Test showing that clerks go on break when there
		 * are no customers in their lines. The test forks
		 * 2 of each clerk and 0 customers, so that they 
		 * will go on break once the simulation starts.
		 */
		 
		 
			 /*customerCashiertest.c*/
		/*
		 *	Test to demonstrate customers entering and leaving the passport office,
		 *  but only interactions with the cashier clerk, namely that they only leave once
		 *  they received their passport, and that the cashclerk only interacts with them
		 *  one at a time. Forks 3 customers to only do a routine to run the doCashClerk() 
		 *	in customer, and sets valid = true for all of them, so they can pay the cashier
		 * 	and leave.
		*/	
		
			/*customerLinetest.c*/
		/* Checks to make sure customers always
		 * choose the shortest line. Manually sets the
		 * line length of the appLine to 3. No clerks
		 * are forked in this test, so the program exits
		 * once all customers have gotten in line.
		 */
		 
			 /*managerClerkTest.c*/
		/* This test shows that the manager
		 * wakes up clerks if they have people in their lines.
		 * This is simulated by forking customers before clerks.
		 * The forked ManagerClerkTest function sets the line lengths
		 * to test values, but no customers are forked. The program
		 * will exit after all clerks wake up.
		 */
		 
		 
		 	/*ManagerTest.c*/
		/*
		 * Test to ensure that the
		 * Manager does not check multiple clerks
		 * at the same time. 2 of each clerk are forked,
		 * and their cash values set to 500 each, except
		 * the cashier, who has 0. This is to trigger
		 * the managers cashChecking routine, which executes
		 * when cashier's cash == numCustomers*100. No customers
		 * are forked, so the value must be 0.
		 */
		 
		 
		 
		
		nrun: Runs "nachos -rs XXXX -x ../test/officeMain" with every value of RS up to 1 to 9998
			- We used this once we verified our simulation worked without random yielding.  Certain race conditions only occur in one or a few random
			  seeds, so we used this to verify complete and total accuracy.  nrun will exit if a -rs value causes nachos to fail.  Also, if nrun hangs
			  forever, we knew we had a race condition with that -rs value, so we were able to run it, read the TEST output, and debug.


VI. DISCUSSION

As far as we can tell, our project has no race conditions or deadlock. We used nrun to check many random seed values, and our program never broke.
All customers leave the office when senators arrive, and re-enter once they finish. Everyone leaves the office by the end. Customers and senators
are never in the office at the same time.  We can also execute multiple simulations at once by execing them.


VII. MISCELLANEOUS

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions. We'd be happy to meet to meet up and discuss any issues/what's going on in the simulation.
